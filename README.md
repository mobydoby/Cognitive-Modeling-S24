# Cognitive-Projects-S24
This repositiory contains projects for RPI Cognitive Modeling S2024

Cognitive Modeling provides the mechanisms and methodologies that 
allow the fields of psychology and cognitive science to become 
a hard science, quantative and reprocible. Currently, psychological models
often times use black box models that uses natural language to describe 
certain "modules of the brain" with plenty of arrows to signal correlations,
yet provide no actual hard evidence of this descriptive model. Subsequently, 
there arises a dilemma in psychology where many well know effects are 
NOT reproducible. Cognitive models investigate psychological and cognitive
problems with a computational framework. Using computation can leverage data
driven approaches to describe psychological and cognitive phenomenon, narrowly 
averting non-reproducible experiment hell.
