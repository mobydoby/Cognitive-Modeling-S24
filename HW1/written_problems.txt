Problem 1
    1. True
    2. True
    3. False
    4. False
    5. False
    6. False
    7. True
    8. True

Problem 3
    git restore - returns the state of your files back to the most recent commit
    git checkout - allows you to switch branches.
    git reset - used to undo changes. Depending on the flags used, the changes
        may or may not erase previous commits. 
    git revert - a safer way to undo changes. allows you to revert your repo to a
        previous commit hash. git revert will commit a change that undoes the 
        changes up to the previous commit.

Problem 3
    Expectation Calculation:
    0.8*1.01 + 0.2*0.9 = 0.988

    Minimum Price to invest:
    1.01 = 0.8 * (1 + x) + 0.2 * 0.9
    1.01 = 0.8*x + 0.8 + 0.18
    0.03 = 0.8*x 
    0.0375 = x

    It would have to go up 3.75%

Problem 4:
    See attached png files.

Problem 5:

    S = Second Person's statement
    F = First Person's statement

    P(F = True | S = Yes) =
        P(S = Yes | F = True) * P(F = True) / P(S = Yes) = 
        P(S = Yes | F = True) * P(F = True) / ( P(S = Yes | F = True) + P(S = Yes | F = False) )

    P(F = True | S = Yes) = (1/3) * (1/3) / [(1/9) + (4/9)] = (1/9)/(5/9) = 1/5

    there is a 20 percent chance that he is telling the truth.
