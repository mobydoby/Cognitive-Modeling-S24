git restore - returns the state of your files back to the most recent commit
git checkout - allows you to switch branches.
git reset - used to undo changes. Depending on the flags used, the changes
    may or may not erase previous commits. 
git revert - a safer way to undo changes. allows you to revert your repo to a
    previous commit hash. git revert will commit a change that undoes the 
    changes up to the previous commit.

Problem 3
Expectation Calculation:
0.8*1.01 + 0.2*0.9 = 0.988

Minimum Price to invest:
1.01 = 0.8 * (1 + x) + 0.2 * 0.9
1.01 = 0.8*x + 0.8 + 0.18
0.03 = 0.8*x 
0.0375 = x

It would have to go up 3.75%
